# 🤖 Autonomous Agentic Risk Intelligence: Twitter Analysis
## 🚀 The Agentic Evolution
This project demonstrates the transition from manual data monitoring to **Autonomous Risk Discovery**. By leveraging a multi-agent AI architecture, the system automates the identification and prioritization of market threats within complex social media datasets.
---
## 🎯 Strategic Mission
The system focuses on scaling intelligence:
> **"How can autonomous agents reduce the manual overhead of social media monitoring while maintaining high precision in risk detection?"**

## 🧠 Agent Architecture: The "Hunter-Critic" Governance
The core of this project is a self-reflecting multi-agent system designed to replace static filtering with dynamic reasoning.
### 1. The Risk Intelligence Agent (The "Hunter")
- **Autonomous Role:** Analyzes unstructured tweet datasets for emerging anomalies.
- **Cognitive Task:** Identifies sentiment shifts, geopolitical triggers, and brand risks.
- **Optimization:** Focused on **Recall** to capture all potential high-impact signals.
### 2. The QA & Reflection Agent (The "Critic")
- **Autonomous Role:** Audits findings through Agentic Reflection.
- **Cognitive Task:** Cross-validates findings, reduces potential hallucinations, and assigns a **Severity Score (1-10)**.
- **Optimization:** Focused on **Precision** to ensure results are actionable for decision-makers.

## 🛠️ The Agentic Stack
- **Orchestration:** LangChain (agentic chains) → migrating to CrewAI multi-agent framework
- **Intelligence:** Llama-3.3-70B (via Groq)
- **Language:** Python 3.12
- **Data Handling:** Pandas

## ⚙️ Intelligent Data Engineering
Data is pre-processed to maximize the "Signal-to-Noise" ratio for LLM-based analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Systematic cleaning of URLs and metadata to isolate raw human intent.
- **Temporal Consistency:** UTC normalization for accurate event correlation across global time zones.
- **Resilient Execution:** Robust error handling to maintain continuity during batch processing.
